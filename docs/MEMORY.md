The code for the MCB is in `src/memory_controller/generated`. It is Xilinx IP generated by the CORE generator, slightly edited to move the clock generation out. It is configued as a 166MHz MT46H32M16 LPDDR on bank 3 with two 32-bit bi-directional ports. It uses a single-ended clock and uses round robin arbitration.

To make changes to the memory, I recommend
  - Using ISE project navigation to add an IP core. Choose Spartan-6 memory interface and name it mem32.
  - Configure it with the settings mentioned above.
  - Now copy `mem32.vhd` and `memc3_wrapper.vhd` from `ipcore_dir/mem32/user_design/rtl` to `src/memory_interface/generated`

Now, `mem32.vhd` needs to be changed slightly. I recommend using an IDE with diff capabilities so you can see what changes I made in that file, and re-apply those. The changes should consist of:
  1. Adding some clock ports as input instead of internal signals
  2. Removing the clocking logic

If you add or remove ports, `src/memory_controller/memory_interface.vhd` should be changed accordingly.
